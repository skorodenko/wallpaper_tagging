  abstract      = "We present a simple, highly modularized network architecture
                   for image classification. Our network is constructed by
                   repeating a building block that aggregates a set of
                   transformations with the same topology. Our simple design
                   results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has
                   only a few hyper-parameters to set. This strategy exposes a
                   new dimension, which we call ``cardinality'' (the size of
                   the set of transformations), as an essential factor in
                   addition to the dimensions of depth and width. On the
                   ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the
                   restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing
                   cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy.
                   Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than
                   going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our
                   models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to
                   the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd
                   place. We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set
                   and the COCO detection set, also showing better results than
                   its ResNet counterpart. The code and models are publicly
                   available online.",
