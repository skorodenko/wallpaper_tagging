                   recent times, with the rise of the Artificial Neural Network

Prior work typically models image metadata parametrically, in contrast, our nonparametric treatment allows our model to perform well even when the vocabulary of metadata changes between training and testing. We perform comprehensive experiments on the NUS-WIDE dataset, where we show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multilabel image annotation even when our model is forced to generalize to new types of metadata.},

abstract = {With the widespread availability of cellphones and cameras that have GPS capabilities, it is common for images being uploaded to the Internet today to have GPS coordinates associated with them. In addition to research that tries to predict GPS coordinates from visual features, this also opens up the door to problems that are conditioned on the availability of GPS coordinates. In this work, we tackle the problem of performing image classification with location context, in which we are given the GPS coordinates for images in both the train and test phases. We explore different ways of encoding and extracting features from the GPS coordinates, and show how to naturally incorporate these features into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the current state-of-the-art for most image classification and recognition problems. We also show how it is possible to simultaneously learn the optimal pooling radii for a subset of our features within the CNN framework. To evaluate our model and to help promote research in this area, we identify a set of location-sensitive concepts and annotate a subset of the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100M dataset that has GPS coordinates with these concepts, which we make publicly available. By leveraging location context, we are able to achieve almost a $7\%$ gain in mean average precision.},

                   exploit label correlations to achieve good performance.
                   However, emphasizing correlation like co-occurrence may
                   overlook discriminative features of the target itself and
                   lead to model overfitting, thus undermining the performance.
                   In this study, we propose a generic framework named Parallel
                   Self-Distillation (PSD) for boosting MLIC models. PSD
                   decomposes the original MLIC task into several simpler MLIC
                   sub-tasks via two elaborated complementary task
                   decomposition strategies named Co-occurrence Graph Partition
                   (CGP) and Dis-occurrence Graph Partition (DGP). Then, the
                   MLIC models of fewer categories are trained with these
                   sub-tasks in parallel for respectively learning the joint
                   patterns and the category-specific patterns of labels.
                   Finally, knowledge distillation is leveraged to learn a
                   compact global ensemble of full categories with these
                   learned patterns for reconciling the label correlation
                   exploitation and model overfitting. Extensive results on
                   MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrate that our framework
                   can be easily plugged into many MLIC approaches and improve
                   performances of recent state-of-the-art approaches. The

                   solving the multi-label classification problem. The proposed
                   approach leverages Transformer decoders to query the
                   existence of a class label. The use of Transformer is rooted
                   in the need of extracting local discriminative features
                   adaptively for different labels, which is a strongly desired
                   property due to the existence of multiple objects in one
                   image. The built-in cross-attention module in the
                   Transformer decoder offers an effective way to use label
                   embeddings as queries to probe and pool class-related
                   features from a feature map computed by a vision backbone
                   for subsequent binary classifications. Compared with prior
                   works, the new framework is simple, using standard
                   Transformers and vision backbones, and effective,

abstract = {Multi-label image classification is a fundamental but challenging task in computer vision. Great progress has been achieved by exploiting semantic relations between labels in recent years. However, conventional approaches are unable to model the underlying spatial relations between labels in multi-label images, because spatial annotations of the labels are generally not provided. In this paper, we propose a unified deep neural network that exploits both semantic and spatial relations between labels with only image-level supervisions. Given a multi-label image, our proposed Spatial Regularization Network (SRN) generates attention maps for all labels and captures the underlying relations between them via learnable convolutions. By aggregating the regularized classification results with original results by a ResNet-101 network, the classification performance can be consistently improved. The whole deep neural network is trained end-to-end with only image-level annotations, thus requires no additional efforts on image annotations. Extensive evaluations on 3 public datasets with different types of labels show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts and has strong generalization capability. Analysis of the learned SRN model demonstrates that it can effectively capture both semantic and spatial relations of labels for improving classification performance.},

abstract = {The CNN-RNN design pattern is increasingly widely applied in a variety of image annotation tasks including multi-label classification and captioning. Existing models use the weakly semantic CNN hidden layer or its transform as the image embedding that provides the interface between the CNN and RNN. This leaves the RNN overstretched with two jobs: predicting the visual concepts and modelling their correlations for generating structured annotation output. Importantly this makes the end-to-end training of the CNN and RNN slow and ineffective due to the difficulty of back propagating gradients through the RNN to train the CNN. We propose a simple modification to the design pattern that makes learning more effective and efficient. Specifically, we propose to use a semantically regularised embedding layer as the interface between the CNN and RNN. Regularising the interface can partially or completely decouple the learning problems, allowing each to be more effectively trained and jointly training much more efficient. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the art performance is achieved on multi-label classification as well as image captioning.},

abstract = {While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a great success in single-label image classification, it is important to note that real world images generally contain multiple labels, which could correspond to different objects, scenes, actions and attributes in an image. Traditional approaches to multi-label image classification learn independent classifiers for each category and employ ranking or thresholding on the classification results. These techniques, although working well, fail to explicitly exploit the label dependencies in an image. In this paper, we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address this problem. Combined with CNNs, the proposed CNN-RNN framework learns a joint image-label embedding to characterize the semantic label dependency as well as the image-label relevance, and it can be trained end-to-end from scratch to integrate both information in a unified framework. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-label classification models.},

  abstract      = "Deep neural networks have enabled progress in a wide variety
                   of applications. Growing the size of the neural network
                   typically results in improved accuracy. As model sizes grow,
                   the memory and compute requirements for training these
                   models also increases. We introduce a technique to train
                   deep neural networks using half precision floating point
                   numbers. In our technique, weights, activations and
                   gradients are stored in IEEE half-precision format.
                   Half-precision floating numbers have limited numerical range
                   compared to single-precision numbers. We propose two
                   techniques to handle this loss of information. Firstly, we
                   recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of the weights
                   that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step.
                   This single-precision copy is rounded to half-precision
                   format during training. Secondly, we propose scaling the
                   loss appropriately to handle the loss of information with
                   half-precision gradients. We demonstrate that this approach
                   works for a wide variety of models including convolution
                   neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative
                   adversarial networks. This technique works for large scale
                   models with more than 100 million parameters trained on
                   large datasets. Using this approach, we can reduce the
                   memory consumption of deep learning models by nearly 2x. In
                   future processors, we can also expect a significant
                   computation speedup using half-precision hardware units.",
